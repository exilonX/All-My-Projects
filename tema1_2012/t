Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and

Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered

system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular

considerably in the future.

interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of

Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.

This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network

at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.

may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD

This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network

company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the

Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of

group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered

local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular

considerably in the future.

interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of

This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network

been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.

Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect

Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,

This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network

commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of

distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered

system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular

15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are

This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network

a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.

computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks

goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.

when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered

15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are

This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network

But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as

1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).

networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.

one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered

15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are

Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.

This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network

everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as

or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).

customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.

version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of

Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight

network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the

the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.

A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.

the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).

Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most

Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of

Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight

network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the

If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.

In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[

''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).

played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most

answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.

Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk

version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.

humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that

Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to

14

Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the

personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail

same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the

machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[

''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).

15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most

All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.

humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that

Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to

14

This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network

If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail

same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.

at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual

machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[

''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).

interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most

become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.

version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select

humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that

Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to

This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail

same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.

at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual

known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.

''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).

television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most

professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the

Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to

This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally

a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for

been impossible.

coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web

''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).

Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most

cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's

Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to

that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally

network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single

of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).

Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.

and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-

Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.

Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to

access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally

exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer

and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).

gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.

for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are

stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even

every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally

Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer

and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).

simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may

Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.

Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are

stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even

every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally

Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer

and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).

simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may

Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.

Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are

stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even

every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally

Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer

and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).

simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may

Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.

Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are

stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even

every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally

Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer

and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).

simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may

Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.

Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are

stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even

every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally

Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer

and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).

simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may

Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.

Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are

stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even

every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally

Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer

and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).

simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may

Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.

Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are

stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even

every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally

Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer

and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).

simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may

Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.

Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are

stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even

every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally

Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer
network. By the end of this book, it should be clear why. The quick answer is: the Internet is not a single network
but a network of networks and the Web is a distributed system that runs on top of the Internet.
There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key
distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single
coherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Often a layer of
software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-
known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document (Web
page).
In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual
machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way. If the
machines have different hardware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user
wants to run a program on a remote machine, he [ ] has to log onto that machine and run it there.
[
]
''He'' should be read as ''he or she'' throughout this book.
In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree
of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with
the software (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.
11
Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects. For example, both distributed systems
and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).
1.1 Uses of Computer Networks
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why
people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in
computer networks, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at companies and for
individuals and then move on to recent developments regarding mobile users and home networking.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Many companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have separate
computers to monitor production, keep track of inventories, and do the payroll. Initially, each of these computers
may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect
them to be able to extract and correlate information about the entire company.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing, and the goal is to make all programs,
equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the
resource and the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common
printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often
cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain than a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, scanners, and CD
burners, is sharing information. Every large and medium-sized company and many small companies are vitally
dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, inventories, accounts
receivable, financial statements, tax information, and much more online. If all of its computers went down, a bank
could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with a computer-controlled assembly line,
would not last even that long. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on
computer networks for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for
larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many
countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
database in Singapore. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data
should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local. This goal may be summarized by saying
that it is an attempt to end the ''tyranny of geography.''
In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company's information system as consisting of one or more
databases and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are
stored on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system
administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they
access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to
the human user of the client machine as the ''client,'' but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the
computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note
that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We will use this form when we mean a
network in the abstract sense. When more detail is required, it will be provided.
Figure 1-1. A network with two clients and one server.
12
This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network
usage. It is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (e.g., belong to the same
company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the
World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user's
personal computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number of clients.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine
and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over
the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process
gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These
messages are shown in Fig. 1-2.
Figure 1-2. The client-server model involves requests and replies.
A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even
computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually
every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally
use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much e-mail
everyone has to deal with, much of it meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the
same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
But e-mail is not the only form of improved communication made possible by computer networks. With a
network, it is easy for two or more people who work far apart to write a report together. When one worker makes
a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for
a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had
been impossible.
Yet another form of computer-assisted communication is videoconferencing. Using this technology, employees
at distant locations can hold a meeting, seeing and hearing each other and even writing on a shared virtual
blackboard. Videoconferencing is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. It
is sometimes said that communication and transportation are having a race, and whichever wins will make the
other obsolete.
A third goal for increasingly many companies is doing business electronically with other companies, especially
suppliers and customers. For example, manufacturers of automobiles, aircraft, and computers, among others,
buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks,
manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. Being able to place orders in real time (i.e., as
needed) reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.
13
A fourth goal that is starting to become more important is doing business with consumers over the Internet.
Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping
from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders
on-line. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future. It is called e-commerce (electronic commerce).
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor
in the world (after IBM). When asked why Digital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way,
he said: ''There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.'' History showed otherwise and
Digital no longer exists. Why do people buy computers for home use? Initially, for word processing and games,
but in recent years that picture has changed radically. Probably the biggest reason now is for Internet access.
Some of the more popular uses of the Internet for home users are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Access to remote information.
Person-to-person communication.
Interactive entertainment.
Electronic commerce.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just
for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies,
recreation, science, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plus some ways
that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone on-line and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a
newspaper that you want everything about corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and
epidemics, but no football, thank you. Sometimes it is even possible to have the selected articles downloaded to
your hard disk while you sleep or printed on your printer just before breakfast. As this trend continues, it will
cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because distribution has
always been the weakest link in the whole production chain.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the on-line digital library. Many
professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society
(www.computer.org), already have many journals and conference proceedings on-line. Other groups are
following rapidly. Depending on the cost, size, and weight of book-sized notebook computers, printed books may
become obsolete. Skeptics should take note of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated
manuscript.
All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a remote database full of information.
The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century's
answer to the 19th century's telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis by millions of people all over the
world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audio and video as well as text and pictures.
Smell may take a while.
Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived from the UNIX talk
program in use since around 1970, allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. A multiperson
version of this idea is the chat room, in which a group of people can type messages for all to see.
Worldwide newsgroups, with discussions on every conceivable topic, are already commonplace among a select
group of people, and this phenomenon will grow to include the population at large. These discussions, in which
one person posts a message and all the other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it, run the gamut from
humorous to impassioned. Unlike chat rooms, newsgroups are not real time and messages are saved so that
when someone comes back from vacation, all messages that have been posted in the meanwhile are patiently
waiting for reading.
Another type of person-to-person communication often goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication, to
distinguish it from the client-server model (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individuals who form a loose
14
group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle,
communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Peer-to-peer communication really hit the big time around 2000 with a service called Napster, which at its peak
had over 50 million music fans swapping music, in what was probably the biggest copyright infringement in all of
recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). The idea was fairly simple. Members registered
the music they had on their hard disks in a central database maintained on the Napster server. If a member
wanted a song, he checked the database to see who had it and went directly there to get it. By not actually
keeping any music on its machines, Napster argued that it was not infringing anyone's copyright. The courts did
not agree and shut it down.
However, the next generation of peer-to-peer systems eliminates the central database by having each user
maintain his own database locally, as well as providing a list of other nearby people who are members of the
system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get a list of other members to
inspect for more music and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely to build up a large
local database of what is out there. It is an activity that would get tedious for people but is one at which
computers excel.
Legal applications for peer-to-peer communication also exist. For example, fans sharing public domain music or
sample tracks that new bands have released for publicity purposes, families sharing photos, movies, and
genealogical information, and teenagers playing multiperson on-line games. In fact, one of the most popular
Internet applications of all, e-mail, is inherently peer-to-peer. This form of communication is expected to grow
considerably in the future.
Electronic crime is not restricted to copyright law. Another hot area is electronic gambling. Computers have been
simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.
15
On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
Each of the past three centuries has been dominated by a single technology. The 18th century was the era of
the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the
steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention
of radio and television, the birth and unprecedented growth of the computer industry, and the launching of
communication satellites.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging and the differences between
collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with
hundreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current
status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute
information grows, the demand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air
transportation), computers have made spectacular progress in a short time. During the first two decades of their
existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infrequently, this
room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized
company or university might have had one or two computers, while large institutions had at most a few dozen.
The idea that within twenty years equally powerful computers smaller than postage stamps would be mass
produced by the millions was pure science fiction.
The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are
organized. The concept of the ''computer center'' as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work
for processing is now totally obsolete. The old model of a single computer serving all of the organization's
computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected
computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these
networks are the subjects of this book.
Throughout the book we will use the term ''computer network'' to mean a collection of autonomous computers
interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to
exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and
communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see
later. Although it may sound strange to some people, neither the Internet nor the World Wide Web is a computer

and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies in who invokes the movement, the system
or the user. Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also important in
distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2002).

simulating things for decades. Why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more
gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other
places (England, for example) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What
happens if the gambler and the casino are in different countries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
Other communication-oriented applications include using the Internet to carry telephone calls, video phone, and
Internet radio, three rapidly growing areas. Another application is telelearning, meaning attending 8 A.M. classes
without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance
human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others.
Our third category is entertainment, which is a huge and growing industry. The killer application here (the one
that may drive all the rest) is video on demand. A decade or so hence, it may be possible to select any movie or
television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may
become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder
Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become
interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on.

On the other hand, maybe the killer application will not be video on demand. Maybe it will be game playing.
Already we have multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight
simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. If games are
played with goggles and three-dimensional real-time, photographic-quality moving images, we have a kind of
worldwide shared virtual reality.
Our fourth category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shopping is already popular
and enables users to inspect the on-line catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs will soon
provide the ability to get an instant video on any product by just clicking on the product's name. After the
customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, on-line technical support may be
consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is already happening is access to financial institutions. Many people already
pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This will surely grow as
networks become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). On-line auctions of second-hand
goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model,
on-line auctions are more of a peer-to-peer system, sort of consumer-to-consumer. Some of these forms of e-
commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ''to'' and ''2'' are pronounced the same. The most
popular ones are listed in Fig. 1-4.
